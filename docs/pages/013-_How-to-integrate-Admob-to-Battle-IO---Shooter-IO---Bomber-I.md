I have made Admob integration (can download it here [https://github.com/insthync/unity-simple-monetization-admob/releases](https://github.com/insthync/unity-simple-monetization-admob/releases))

After import, add AdmobMonetizationManager at the same game object which added MonetizationManager then set an App Id (can get it from Admob
